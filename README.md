# CPXPong
A Pong-based game for the Circuit Playground Express using six external buttons.

Pong.io was a project code for AER E 361 at Iowa State University. I used a Circuit Playground Express along with six basic buttons (three on each side) to create a simple Pong game, playing to 5. You are free to use this code without citation as long as it is not being directly copied for use in AER E 361.
